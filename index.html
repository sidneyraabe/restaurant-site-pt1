                At The Rusty Grill, "quality" is our middle name. Well, technically it's "Rusty," but you get the point.<br />
                Our ingredients come from the finest farmers around. Our meat is so fresh we'll even slaughter it right <br />
                in front of you. That's how you know we mean business. Now that we mention it, "business" is also our middle name,<br />
                because we love money. So much so that we don't pay our waiters. Their income is payed by your tips, only. </p>
